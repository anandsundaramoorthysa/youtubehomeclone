## About Project  
The **YouTube Home Clone** project is a replication of YouTube's home page layout, designed to refresh and refine my HTML and CSS skills after a five-month break. Inspired by [SuperSimpleDev's HTML & CSS full course](https://youtu.be/G3e-cpL7ofc?si=XhPtpbt50xxskw43), I updated the design to reflect the current YouTube layout, incorporating modern UI elements like curved borders for video profiles and a redesigned header and sidebar.
